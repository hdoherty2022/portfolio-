                        <h2 class="major">hobbies</h2>
                        <p>i first got started with playing guitar, when i was around 10 years old. my uncle bought me my first guitar, a red squier mini stratocaster. He is also a guitar player, and a drummer but he is amazing, and a lot better than me. it is probably one of my favorite hobbies i have. i like playing the acoustic guitar better than the electric because its more relaxing and soothing to play.</p>

                        <h2 class="major">sports</h2>
                        <p>i have played many sports in my life. i have danced since the age of 2, but i had to quit this year for high school sports. i started playing lacrosse and field hockey in 6th grade, and it was probably one of the best decisions ever. i love those two sports and i met my two best friends. i had field hockey tryouts for my high school this fall (i am a freshman) and they were actually really fun. i made varsity with my two friends lily and olivia. that was so amazing, and an amazing opportunity. in the winter i played JV basketball, and JV lacrosse. i also play indoor field hockey, for seacoast united, and lacrosse, for twisters. </p>

                        <p>when i get older i hope to go on a cross- country road trip with all of my close friends, and to travel the world to all different countries. The one country that i really want to travel to is greece. My family is greek, and my uncle has gone multiple times, which i am very jealous of.  </p>
